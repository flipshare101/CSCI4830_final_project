# CSCI4830_final_project

Notes - spaceinvaders3.py was an early version of SpaceInvaders_Training.py, based heavily on the code here - https://github.com/adventuresinML/adventures-in-ml-code.

SpaceInvaders_Training.py is the completed training script that we used to train the models. There is also a script at the bottom that can be used to run the models in real-time (they won't be training though).

python_code.py is the script used to generate the graphs in our paper.

python_object_files contains the model performance data in `pickle` object files.

model_weights contains the model weights for the models.

example_scenes contains manim code to generate the visuals used in the final video.
